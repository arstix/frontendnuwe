## Why?

We've developed this project as part of the https://nuwe.io/challenge/jump2digital-front challenge and decided to build it on React as it is the framework we are most familiar with and one of the frameworks that are commonly used. Furthermore:

1. React provides us with more modules which boosts up the process of creating the app.

2. There are components that make the code be more organized.


## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, run

```shell
npm install 
```
